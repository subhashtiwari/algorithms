Bipartite Graph

It is new kind of graph, in this the nodes can be seperated into two groups where there are no edges between nodes in the same group. 

1.  What is the smallest number of edges needed to make  B have a single reachable component consisting of all the nodes?
The question is shown in the image Bipartite also.

The answer is 7. We can solve it by using tree structure as it have all of its node connected.

2. What is the maximum number of edges B can have?

Answer is 15 as for each node of left side we have 5 connection as there are 5 nodes on right side.

3. What is the maximum possible path length in B?

Answer is 6. In a bipartite graph the maximum possibel path length depends on 2 x number of nodes in the smallest group or total number of nodes - 1. 

As the chains have a maximum possible path length of n-1. And n-1 is a maximum possible value on path length of any graph with n nodes.

4. What is the maximum possible clustering coefficient for a node in B.

Answer is zero. As there is no connection between the nodes of same side of the graph so Nv becomes zero, as a result CC(V) also becomes zero.
