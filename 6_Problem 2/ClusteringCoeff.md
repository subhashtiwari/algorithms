In this we find the Order between graphs according to the clustering coefficients. The graphs are in the image Cluster.

For the graph a CC(V) = 1/2

For the graph b CC(V) = 2/21

For the graph c CC(V) = 0, as Nv is zero

For the graph d CC(V) = 1

For the graph e CC(V) = 1/3

For the graph f CC(V) = 1/5
