Below are some statements that are made regarding the relations between different types of Networks.

1. Every Star is a Tree. 
As a tree graph with hierarchial shape cannot be a Star network. 

2. Every Tree is a Planar graph. 
As every planar graph cannot be a tree as a planar graphs with all nodes attached will contradict the statement that in a Tree there should be no ring.
But every tree will always be a planar graph no matter how it is drawn.

3. Every Ring is not a Chain vice-versa.
As a Chain must be in single line, whereas a Ring must hvae cycles.

4. Every Tree is not a Ring vice-versa.
As a Ring must have cycles and Trees cannot have cycles.

5. Every Chain is a Tree.
As Chain should be ina single line and a Tree can be in any form.

6. Every Hypercube is not a Ring vice-versa.
A Ring can never be a hypercube as it only exist in a plane whereas a hypercube is not a planar network.

7. Every Chain is a Grid.
A Chain should be in a single line, this also satisfies for Grid but a Grid can also be Linear aarnagement of square rings.

8. Every Planar graph is not a Hypercube vice-versa.
As a Hypercube does not exist in a plane.
