Degrees of Hardness

There are various types of problems that belong to various category of hardness.

- not computable : There is no computer program that can solve that problem. Halting Problem is such an example.

- computable, at least exponential time : They are solvable with a computer program but they require at least exponential time. Generalized Checker is an example of that.

- computable m polynomial time : These problems are computable in polynomial time. Dijkstra is an example.

- computable in linear time : They can be solved quickly in linear time. Graph connectivity is an example. 


Hardness of a problem is the running time of the very best possible algorithm for that problem.

For some problems we don't know their hardness but we have lower and upper bounds.
