Is P = NP?

This is true as we already know that every problem that's in P is in NP and every problem that is in EXP.
That means that any probelm that can be solved in polynomial time, it can certainly be solved in non-deterministic polynomial time.
And any problem that we solve in a non deterministic polynnomial time, can also be solved in exponential time.

There are three cases to this:

1. Case 1 : The class NP is equal to the class EXP.

2. Case 2 : The class P is equal to the class NP.

3. Case 3 : There are three different categories. None of the class are equal.

The main question is whether or not P=NP. It is still unsolvable.

Though if P = NP then, some cryptographic protocols based on problems like factoring could be cracked.

But it's not.
