If we the upper bound and lower bound of a problem then we know the complexity of that problem.

A good way to find an upper bound on a problem's hardness is by devising an algorithm to solve it. Analyze it and whatever Big O or Big Theta we get is the Upper Bound.

To find a lower bound for finding maximum number in a list we have to go through every element of that list and that takes theta(n) time.
