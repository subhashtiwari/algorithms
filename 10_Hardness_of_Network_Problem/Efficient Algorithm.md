Till now we worked on different algorithm and found out their running time.

Some of them are

- Connectivity between two nodes in an undirected, unweighted graph running time is theta(n+m). 

- Shortest path in weighted graph running time is theta(m logn)

- Removing the minimum value of a heap running time is theta(logn)

- finding shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph running time is theta(n^3).


An algorithm is efficient if it has a polynomial bound on its running time. And a problem can be solved efficiently if it has an efficient algorithm.
