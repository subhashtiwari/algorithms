There are some problems such that if we could solve them first, we could solve all problems in NP fast.
These problems are called NP-Hard problems.

If X is atleast as hard as Y, then we could use the algorithm of X to solve for Y.

That means that Y is polynomially reducible to X if we can solve Y using a polynomial number of calls to a subroutine that solves X.
It means that problem Y has been reduced to problem X.
