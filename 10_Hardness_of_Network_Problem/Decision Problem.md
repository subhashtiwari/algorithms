Decision Problems

A decision can be yes or no for any problem as input or 0 or 1 in case of bits.

For example to get the answer about graph connectivity we have to know if all the nodes are reachable from all other noeds in the graph and the answer is either yes or no.

But getting this can be very complicated to take the input and decide whether it is zero or one.

The decision problem are often directly relateable to the version of the problem that is in question.

Such as If there is a pair of nodes K steps apart that is simply yes or no, but if we want the number of steps k is apart than the Decision is complicated. 

So, if the decision problem is efficient so is the problem that returns the more interesting input.
