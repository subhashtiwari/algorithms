As all problems does not have efficient algorithms, there are some that actually require an exponential amount of running time.

Such as an algorithm with running time of theta(2^n) is not efficient as if n increases the running time will increase rapidly so its not bounded.

There are NP-complete problems that exist between the problems that have efficient solutions that have a polynomial running time and the problems that do not have efficient solutions and have exponential running time. 

The NP-complete problems are very important class, but we don't know if they have polynomial of exponential running time. 
For all the NP-complete problems either they all are easy and fit in the polynomial running time class or they are all hard and fit in the exponential time running class. 
They all hang together that's what is known.
