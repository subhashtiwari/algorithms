NP-Completeness

A problem X is NP-Complete if it satisfies two properties.

1. It has to be NP-Hard. 
Means that, nothing in NP is harder then X. Such that, if X is solvable in polynomial time,, then we can use it to solve everything in NP in polynomial time.

2. X itelf is in NP.
Means that, X is in the set and its as hard as anything in the set. So, it is in fact the hardest in this set.

There are many problems that are NP-complete. There is list, online websites that list lots of problmes. There's wonderfully written books that layout problems after probelms, sometimes they are really natural extensions of each other.

A Question based on NP-Completeness.

If Graph Partitioning(GP) is NP Complete?

If GP is NP-hard then 
- A polynomial time solution solves everything in NP.
- A clique can be reduced to it.
- An exponential time solution exists.
- It can be reduced to SAT.
