A simple path is one which does not have any repeated nodes.

Longest simple path is of length n as it does not have any repeated nodes but it also visits each node.

A problem is shown in image Longest Path.

It shows the longest simple path that follows the path a-b-c-e-e-d-f-g. 

That shows that the length of longest simple path is n, n is number of nodes in that graph.

It can be called as long and simple decision problem.
It like this for a given a graph G a link L and two nodes u and v, is there a simple path from u to v consisting of l or more nodes.

We're not looking for a short path but we're looking for a long and simple path. 

Assume that there ia an algorithm tah solvethis decision problem yes or no correctly and its running time is theta(n^k), k is a constant. And it is bounded by a polynomial.
