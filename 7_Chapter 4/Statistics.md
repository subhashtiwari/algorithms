A statistic is actually quite a simple idea.
It's just a number that summarizes a list of numbers.

If we have a list L - a list of the centrality scores. There's a lot of different statistics that we can imagine that would summarize the list of numbers. 
For example, how many numbers are in the list, what is the largest number in the list?, What is the total of all the scores in the list?, What's the total of all the scores in the list?, etc.

In general when anlysing large structures like social networks, there's a need of summarizing large amount of data, it cannot be presented in its raw form.
