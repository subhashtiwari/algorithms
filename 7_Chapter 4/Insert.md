To insert an element in a heap we stick at the very bottom right corner o fteh heap. Or if the heap is already full, then the far left. 

But if the value we inserted does not follow the heap properties then we run an algorithm called up heapify. It is analogus to down heapify.

In this we take the value and swaps it up and up until it reaches place where it is smaller than both of it's children, which is a property of heap.
