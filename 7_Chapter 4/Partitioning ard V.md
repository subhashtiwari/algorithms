For a random list L, there is an element V in a unsorted list.
This V will go in the sorted list. On the left side are the values less than V and to its right are values greater than V. Apart from that it doesn't matter what the order inside is.
So. it's a kind of partially sorted list, and it is called partitioning around V.
