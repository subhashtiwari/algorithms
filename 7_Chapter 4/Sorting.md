If the list L is sorted several statistics can be computed very easily.

If the list is increasing order, then the position of various statistical values in the list L is

1. Mininum : L[0]

2. Maximum : L[n-1]

3. Midpoint : (L[0] + L[n-1]) / 2

4. Median : L[n/2] 

All these operations run in a constant time, i.e. theta(1), given the list is sorted.

Mean and mode are calculated differently.
