Types of centrality

1. Betweenness Centrality : A node is central if most of the path between arbitrarily chosen pair of nodes in the network end up having to pass through the node in question.

2. Closeness Centrality :  A given node is central if it has short path to other nodes in the network. 

3. Eigen Vector Centrality

4. Degree Centrality : A node is central if it has lot of edges. If it's very well connected.
