Now we analyze the running time of the algorithm of the Connected Component Code.

It involves counting up the number of primitive steps, primitive statements, time that the algorithm takes when solving a problem.

There are two principles of graph search, breadth search and depth first search.

Depth First Search : It is not concerned about the length of the paths, it's just trying to figure out which nodes can be reached by any kind of path.
It is linear in the size of the graph. Running Time is equal to big theta(n+m), where n is no of nodes in the graph and m is the number of edges.

Breadth First Search : It deals with shortest paths.
