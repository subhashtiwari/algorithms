Breadth First Without Recursion.

In breadth first search the process is as follows:

1. Grab the first element of the open list
2. Mark any unmarked neighbour and add to open list
3. Repeat until nothing open

This search expands away from the center unlike that of depth first search which goes in one direction first then in other direction.
This actually finds the shortest paths.
It always expands out in levels.
