Clustering Coefficient is represented by CC(V).
It is just the average of the clustering coefficients of the nodes in the graph.

TO calculate CC(V)

Let V : a node
    K sub v : its degree
    N sub v : the number of liks between neighbours of V.

So, CC(V) = 2 Nv / Kv(Kv-1)

The range is - 0 <= CC(V) <= 1, for star it is 0 and for clique it is 1.
