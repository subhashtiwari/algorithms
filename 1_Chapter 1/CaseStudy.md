For understanding algorithms better we need Mathematics as it helps us in following ways:

1. Formalize what you are doing.
2. Analyze correctness.
3. Analyze efficiency. 

But main focus in this case is time. To know how algorithm works we take two Python codes examples and find out which works faster:
1. Naive
2. Russian


Russian works faster, and it can be analyzed.
