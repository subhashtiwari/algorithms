If the graph is connected and has exactly 2 odd degree nodes, then it has an Eulerian Path, and if not, then it doesn't.

Any graph that is connected and have only even degree nodes will have an Eulerian Path.

Eulerian Path is a trail in a finite graph which visits every edge exactly once. Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex.
