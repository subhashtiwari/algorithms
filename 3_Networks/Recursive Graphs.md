Recursive Graphs are generated by following steps.

1. We start of by n nodes.
2. We create graph on half of the nodes recursively.
3. Then we generate some edges that connect up between these two smaller graphs.
4. And that's the graph that we return.

We can get bunch of different mechanisms for generating recursive graphs with this basic structure, 
depending on how we create the 1st sub graph, and how we create the 2nd sub graph and how we connect
the two sub graphs together.

Recursive Graphs can lead to any type of graph either chain or tree.

An image named Recurrence shows the Recurrence Relations of the graph.

An image named Summary shows different kinds of recurrence relations and several different growth rates which helps in understanding how these graphs work and for algorithm analysis.
