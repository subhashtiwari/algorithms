Planar Graphs can be drrawn on a piece of paper so that the edges don't cross. An example is shown in image Planar Graph.

According to Euler Formula depends on the assumption that the palnar graph is actually drawn in a plane with no edges crossing (or touchings).
It is given as n - m + r = 2. 

There are regions in the graph and is denoted by r. An example is shown in image Regions.
A region in a planar graph has to be encapsulated or has to be bounded by at least three edges.
But as we count an edge twice so 3r should be less than or equal to 2m.
The most edges that we can have in a planar graph is at most linear in the number of nodes.
