Grid network represent the connectivity pattern for a bunch of things as a grid and connect them up.
An example is shown in the image Grid. If we have 20 nodes arranged in a grid then it have 31 edges.

If we have 256 nodes arranged as a square grid, we have 480 edges.

Big theta means that two functions grow roughly the same as each other. This means that if some 
function f(n) is in theta(g(n)) then the opposite of this should also be true, because c1 and c2 can be used from 
the definition of f(n) is in theta(g(n)).

Big Theta makes it easier to write complex function in a much simpler way.
